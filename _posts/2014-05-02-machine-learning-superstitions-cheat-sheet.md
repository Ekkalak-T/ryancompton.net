This notebook contains notes and beliefs about several commonly-used supervised learning algorithms. My dream is that it will be useful as a quick reference or for people who are irrational about studying for machine learning interviews.

After some setup code, the methods discussed are:
+ Logistic regression
+ Decision trees
+ Support vector machines
+ K Nearest neighbors
+ Naive Bayes
